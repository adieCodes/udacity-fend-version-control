# What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository adds the hidden directory **.git**, this keeps all of the meta
 data about historic commits. You need to do this as this is what makes Git work, without it there's no record of the changes made.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value
 do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to select the files you want to add to a commit, providing far
 greater flexibility and control.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only stage the files that are involved with the commit, you can add other files with other
 commits after.

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
 organised? How would branches help?

Branches would be most helpful when adding new features, as this gives you the ability to
 make changes without impacting your known working code. You can then merge the two
  codebases when the new feature is ready and tested.
