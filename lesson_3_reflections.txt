# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working with other people or on other machines, this allows you to work on the same code base.
 It's also useful as a back up, in case anything were to happen to your machine.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
 with your remote repository?
 
 As you don't want changes happening to your code without you at least requesting it, if not authoring it.
